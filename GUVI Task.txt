HTTP1.1 vs HTTP 2.0

1.HTTP 2.0 is a binary protocol that multiplexes numerous streams going over a single (normally TLS-encrypted) TCP connection.

2.The contents of each stream are HTTP 1.1 requests and responses, just encoded and packed up differently. 

3.HTTP 2.0 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP1.1. It prioritizes content during the loading process.


HTTP History version
The term hypertext was coined by Ted Nelson in 1965 in the Xanadu Project, which was in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's 1930s vision 
of the microfilm-based information retrieval and management "memex" system described in his 1945 essay "As We May Think". 
Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN are credited with inventing the original HTTP, along with HTML and the associated technology 
for a web server and a text-based web browser. Berners-Lee first proposed the "WorldWideWeb" project in 1989â€”now known as the World Wide Web. 
The first version of the protocol had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server. The response from the server was always an HTML page.

The first documented version of HTTP was HTTP V0.9 (1991). 
Dave Raggett led the HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG) in 1995 and wanted to expand the protocol with extended operations, 
extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields.
RFC 1945 officially introduced and recognized HTTP V1.0 in 1996.

The HTTP WG planned to publish new standards in December 1995 and the support for pre-standard HTTP/1.1 based on the then developing 
RFC 2068 (called HTTP-NG) was rapidly adopted by the major browser developers in early 1996. End-user adoption of the new browsers was rapid.
 In March 1996, one web hosting company reported that over 40% of browsers in use on the Internet were HTTP 1.1 compliant. 
That same web hosting company reported that by June 1996, 65% of all browsers accessing their servers were HTTP/1.1 compliant.
The HTTP/1.1 standard as defined in RFC 2068 was officially released in January 1997. 
Improvements and updates to the HTTP/1.1 standard were released under RFC 2616 in June 1999.

In 2007, the HTTP Working Group was formed, in part, to revise and clarify the HTTP/1.1 specification. In June 2014, the WG released an updated six-part specification obsoleting RFC 2616:

RFC 7230, HTTP/1.1: Message Syntax and Routing
RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1: Semantics and Content
RFC 7232, HTTP/1.1: Conditional Requests
RFC 7233, HTTP/1.1: Range Requests
RFC 7234, HTTP/1.1: Caching
RFC 7235, HTTP/1.1: Authentication
HTTP/2 was published as RFC 7540 in May 2015.


List 5 difference between Browser JS vs Nodejs.
1.JavaScript is a programming language, which runs in web browsers. 
Node.js is an interpreter or running environment for JavaScript which holds a lot of requiring libraries and all.

2.javascript runs in any engine like Fire fox,safari,google chrome(v8).
  Node js runs only in v8 engine.

3.Javascript using for any client side activity for a web application.
  Node js is mainly used for accessing or performing any non blocking operation of any operating system.


what happens when you type url in the address bar in the browser?
Url in the browser is converted by the DNS to access the contents.
HTTP request is sent to access the contents and in response the contents will be poped in the browser
